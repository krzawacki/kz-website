 	  	<p>As Communications Manager at Mozilla, I write words for speeches, products, publications and websites. I also handle press relations.</p>

 	  	<p>Here's a sampling of some recent work:</p>

 	  		<div class="Copywriting2">

 	 			<h6>MOZILLA ADVOCACY: ENCRYPT</h6>

 	 			<img id="encryption" src="encryption2.jpg" height="100px" width="100px">

	 			<p>I led communications for Mozilla's <a href="https://advocacy.mozilla.org/en-US/encrypt/">Encrypt</a> campaign, a public education initiative that taught everyday internet users about encryption's importance. I authored campaign copy, custom content and assisted with script writing. The campaign reached millions of users and garnered coverage on <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/02/19/467318811/mozilla-foundation-backs-apple-in-encryption-case-with-federal-government">NPR</a> and <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/18/opinions/apple-encryption-backdoor-fbi-surman/"> CNN</a>.</p>

     			<h6><br><br>MOZILLA ADVOCACY: WEB FELLOWS</h6>

     			<img id="fellows" src="fellows.jpg" height="100px" width="100px">

     			<p>Mozilla's <a href="https://advocacy.mozilla.org/en-US/open-web-fellows/">Open Web Fellowship</a> places talented technologists at organizations like Amnesty International and the ACLU. Its mission: Help the world's leading NGOs keep the web open and free. I authored our Year 1 publication, an in-depth exploration of the program's success and impact. <a href="http://mozilla.github.io/content/open-web-fellows-report/#introduction/">Read the report</a>.</p>

     			<h6><br><br>MOZILLA LEARNING: THIMBLE</h6>

     			<img id="thimble" src="Thimble.jpg" height="100px" width="120px">

     			<p>I led communications around the re-launch of <a href="https://thimble.mozilla.org/en-US/">Thimble</a>, Mozilla's free code editor and teaching tool. The re-launch featured a suite of clever copywriting ("Coding, Decoded") and earned placements in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/01/mozilla-relaunches-its-thimble-online-code-editor-for-teaching-html-css-and-javascript/">TechCrunch</a> and several other influential publications.</p>

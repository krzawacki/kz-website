 		<h5><a name="CopywritingPage">CREATIVE</a></h5>

 	  	<p>As Editorial Lead at Mozilla, I write words for speeches, products, publications and websites. I also handle press relations.</p>

 	  	<p>Here's a sampling of some recent work:</p>

 	  		<div class="Copywriting2">

 	  			<h6>MOZILLA'S COPYRIGHT REFORM CAMPAIGN</h6>

 	  			<img id="copyright" src="copyright.jpg" height="100px" width="100px">

 	  			<p>In 2016, Mozilla launched a <a href="https://www.changecopyright.org">campaign</a> to reform oppressive copyright law in the European Union -- and I served as a creative and communications lead. I wrote advocacy copy and slogans, opinion pieces, and scripts (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG10a1F9gU0">like this one</a>). And I led a PR push that garnered 117 stories (<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/08/26/mozilla_eu_copyright_protest/">like this one</a>) in 21 countries.</p>


 	  		 	<h6>MOZILLA FESTIVAL SPEAKER SERIES</h6>


 	  		 	<p>I was chief architect and curator of the Mozilla Festival's first-ever speaker series, which brought 12 marquee-name speakers to London for TED-style talks. The theme: Internet Health. The speakers: Zeynep Tufekci, Katherine Maher, Chris Soghoian, and nine other luminaries. View photos of the speaker series <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/150437959@N03/albums/72157678052877296">here</a>, and watch the talks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYiaJo7rYNXLQSEAa2RdyyiS28Ke2Rl60">here</a>.</p>

 	  		 	

 	 			<h6>MOZILLA'S ENCRYPTION CAMPAIGN</h6>

 	 			<img id="encryption" src="encryption2.jpg" height="100px" width="100px">

	 			<p>I led communications for Mozilla's <a href="https://advocacy.mozilla.org/en-US/encrypt/">Encrypt</a> campaign, a public education initiative that taught everyday internet users about encryption's importance. I authored campaign copy, custom content and assisted with script writing. The campaign reached millions of users and garnered coverage on <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/02/19/467318811/mozilla-foundation-backs-apple-in-encryption-case-with-federal-government">NPR</a> and <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/18/opinions/apple-encryption-backdoor-fbi-surman/"> CNN</a>.</p>


     			<h6>OPEN WEB FELLOWS</h6>


     			<p>Mozilla's <a href="https://advocacy.mozilla.org/en-US/open-web-fellows/">Open Web Fellowship</a> places talented technologists at organizations like Amnesty International and the ACLU. Its mission: Help the world's leading NGOs keep the web open and free. I authored our Year 1 publication, an in-depth exploration of the program's success and impact. <a href="http://mozilla.github.io/content/open-web-fellows-report/#introduction/">Read the report</a>.</p>

     			<h6>MOZILLA THIMBLE</h6>

     			<img id="thimble" src="Thimble.jpg" height="100px" width="120px">

     			<p>I led communications around the re-launch of <a href="https://thimble.mozilla.org/en-US/">Thimble</a>, Mozilla's free code editor and teaching tool. The re-launch featured a suite of clever copywriting ("Coding, Decoded") and earned placements in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/01/mozilla-relaunches-its-thimble-online-code-editor-for-teaching-html-css-and-javascript/">TechCrunch</a> and several other influential publications.</p>

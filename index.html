<div class="About">

    <p>
    This is my website. (It's ugly because I coded it myself.)
    </p>

	<p>
	I'm a journalist whose work has appeared in <strong>The Atlantic</strong>, <strong>Slate</strong>, <strong>The Daily Beast</strong>, <strong>Al Jazeera America</strong>, <strong>Fast Company</strong>, <strong>VICE</strong>, <strong>Smithsonian Magazine</strong>, and a range of other publications. I have deep experience as a writer, editor and newsroom leader, and have reported from NYC, London and San Francisco.

	I'm also a communications professional with copywriting, speech writing and ghostwriting savvy.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<strong>I’m currently Communications Manager with the Mozilla Foundation</strong>, the global nonprofit behind Firefox. I act as the Foundation’s chief writer, penning copy for advocacy campaigns, product launches and executive keynotes.
